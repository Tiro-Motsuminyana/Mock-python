# mock-python: Beginner Exercises
# --------------------------------
# Complete the following functions according to the instructions.
# Each function will be tested automatically using unittests.

# Exercise 1: Function Parameters
# Write a function that accepts two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
# Example: add_numbers(2, 3) should return 5

def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    Accepts two numbers and returns their sum.
    """
    # Your code here
    pass


# Exercise 2: FizzBuzz
# Print numbers from 1 to n.
# Rules:
# - For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
# - For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
# - For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
# Example: fizzbuzz(5) prints:
# 1
# 2
# Fizz
# 4
# Buzz

def fizzbuzz(n):
    """
    Prints FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to n.
    """
    # Your code here
    pass


# Exercise 3: Fibonacci
# Return the nth Fibonacci number (0-indexed: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...)
# Explanation:
# - Fibonacci sequence: each number is the sum of the previous two numbers
# - Example: fibonacci(0) = 0, fibonacci(1) = 1, fibonacci(5) = 5
# - Indexing starts at 0: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...

def fibonacci(n: int):
    """
    Returns the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
    """
    # Your code here
    pass


# Exercise 4: Maximum Finder
# Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest one.
# Example: find_max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) should return 5

def find_max(numbers: list):
    """
    Returns the largest number in a list.
    """
    # Your code here
    pass


# Exercise 5: Minimum Finder
# Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the smallest one.
# Example: find_min([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) should return 1

def find_min(numbers: list):
    """
    Returns the smallest number in a list.
    """
    # Your code here
    pass
